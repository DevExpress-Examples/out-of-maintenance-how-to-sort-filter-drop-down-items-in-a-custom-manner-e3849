# How to sort filter drop-down items in a custom manner


<p>The following example demonstrates how to sort filter drop-down items in a custom manner.<br />
In this example, the CustomFilterPopupItems event is handled to manage a list of filter items. This event is raised when an end-user invokes the filter drop-down. The event parameter provides access to the filter items list, which is then sorted by the length of the items' captions (if the corresponding option is selected).</p><br />
